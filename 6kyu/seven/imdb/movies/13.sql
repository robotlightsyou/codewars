-- In 13.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all people who starred in a movie in which Kevin Bacon also starred.
-- Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each person.
-- There may be multiple people named Kevin Bacon in the database. Be sure to only select the Kevin Bacon born in 1958.
-- Kevin Bacon himself should not be included in the resulting list.

-- Executing 13.sql results in a table with 1 column and 176 rows.
SELECT name FROM people WHERE people.id
IN
( SELECT person_id FROM stars JOIN movies ON movies.id = stars.movie_id
WHERE movie_id IN
( SELECT movie_id FROM movies JOIN stars ON stars.movie_id = movies.id JOIN people ON
 people.id = stars.person_id WHERE people.id IN (
SELECT id FROM people WHEREpeople.name = "Kevin Bacon" AND people.birth = 1958 )))
EXCEPT
SELECT name FROM people WHERE people.name = "Kevin Bacon" AND people.birth = 1958
